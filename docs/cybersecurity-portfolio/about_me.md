# About Me


Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is **MA SHANGJU**, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in **Cybersecurity** at the **University of Malaya (UM)**. I have always been deeply passionate about technology, which has driven my academic and professional journey.

Before starting my postgraduate studies, I worked as a **Python backend developer**, focusing on web development. During my career, I was responsible for designing and implementing scalable, secure, and efficient APIs for various web applications. This hands-on experience not only honed my programming and problem-solving skills but also sparked my interest in the security aspects of software development.

My decision to transition into the field of cybersecurity was motivated by a desire to understand and tackle the growing challenges of securing digital infrastructures. As someone who has always been fascinated by how systems work, I am eager to explore vulnerabilities, develop defense mechanisms, and contribute to creating safer digital environments.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am enthusiastic about:
- Automating routine tasks using Python, particularly in network and security contexts.
- Exploring penetration testing and vulnerability analysis through tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite.
- Participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to challenge myself and refine my skills.
- Staying updated with the latest trends in IT and cybersecurity by reading blogs, attending webinars, and experimenting with new tools.

My ultimate goal is to combine my expertise in backend development and cybersecurity to build secure systems that not only function efficiently but also withstand modern cyber threats. I aspire to work on innovative projects that address real-world security challenges and make meaningful contributions to the field.
