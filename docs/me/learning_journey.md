# Learning Journey

Reflecting on my cybersecurity journey so far:

---

## What I've Learned:

### 1. Basic Networking Concepts  
Developed a strong foundation in fundamental networking principles:  
- **Network Architectures**: LAN, WAN, and WLAN.  
- **IP Addressing and Subnetting**: Mastered addressing schemes and the OSI model.  
- **TCP/IP Protocols**: Gained a thorough understanding of protocols used in data communication.

### 2. Router and Switch Configuration  
Gained hands-on experience configuring network devices for optimized performance:  
- Implemented **VLANs**, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing for network segmentation.  
- Configured **static and dynamic routing protocols** like RIP and OSPF.  
- Ensured security using **access control lists (ACLs)** and port security techniques.

### 3. GNS3 and Packet Tracer  
Utilized network simulation tools for designing and troubleshooting networks:  
- Built and tested complex network topologies in **GNS3** and **Packet Tracer**.  
- Simulated routing and switching protocols to deepen practical knowledge.  
- Practiced real-world scenarios to enhance problem-solving and troubleshooting skills.

### 4. Network Scanning with Nmap  
Learned to leverage Nmap for vulnerability assessment:  
- Conducted **host discovery**, port scanning, and service enumeration.  
- Identified open ports and running services to assess network security.  
- Explored the **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** for advanced scan automation.

## Current Challenges:
- **Practical Penetration Testing**: Limited hands-on experience with exploiting different vulnerability types.  
- **Security Knowledge Depth**: Current understanding of security concepts is still surface-level.  
- **Incident Response**: Need to gain experience in managing real-world security incidents.

## Plan for Improvement:

### 1. Expand Practical Experience  
- Engage in **real-world penetration testing labs** (e.g., TryHackMe, Hack The Box).  
- Focus on exploiting a variety of vulnerabilities and documenting each process.

### 2. Deepen Security Knowledge  
- Enroll in comprehensive courses like **OSCP** to build expertise.  
- Study resources on advanced topics, including **exploit development** and **reverse engineering**.  

### 3. Participate in Community Activities  
- Join **Capture the Flag (CTF)** competitions to sharpen technical skills.  
- Collaborate with cybersecurity communities to exchange knowledge and stay updated on trends.
